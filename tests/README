In order to test caseguard with Mercurial, you need to:

    • move caseguard.py in <hg_source>/hgext/
    • move test files in <hg_source>/tests/
    • patch hghave with the patch here
    • in <hg_source>, `make test-caseguard*`

Depending on the operating system you're using, you might run two or three of
the tests (one test is dependent on having a case-sensitive filesystem)
